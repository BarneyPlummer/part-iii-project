\section{Abstract}

An abstract summary of my material. I would like to use this section to lure any potential readers into looking at this exciting treatise on my research topic. I've also been told that in the abstract it's best not to use \emph{bold}, \textit{italics} ,  type \underline{underlined text} or anything else that's too fancy. So maybe I shouldn't have. I've left text I wrote in the rest of this - but that doesn't mean it's worth reading.

% gives a preview of the image which is sometimes missing for 
%.ps images in some dvi viewers. to convert between the two use ps2eps.

\section{Introduction}

The Earth has lots of layers - have a look at Figure~\ref{fig:Earth} to see what they might be. And be aware that this figure is not to scale - though it is pretty. %When you have used the \label{fig:Earth} command in the figure above, every time you would like to refer




\subsection{Making lists}
%an example subsection

Should you need to make lists you can:
\begin{enumerate}
\item list your 
\item points by numbering them
\item without having to change all the numbers if
\item you add a new point in the middle or
\item you rearrange them.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\item On the other hand you may
\item prefer to just have your 
\item objects without numbers
\item and just put bullet points by them
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Typing as vertabim}

The \verb|\verb| command will print the text exactly as you type it, without the pretty \LaTeX formatting.~\footnote{a short comment added hear will appear in a footnote to this page}. 

\subsubsection{Some more text}
However, for waves of very low frequencies and long wavelengths, effects like gravitation, ellipticity and rotation of the Earth become important and the approximations used in the ray theory are invalidated. The best way to model these seismic waves is using normal modes. Normal modes are free oscillations of the whole Earth. The vertical and horizontal motion they cause at the Earth's surface can be detected using a seismograph. for asummary of recent research see Song's review~\cite{song97}.  % refer to a paper included in the bibliography file using it's key - in this case ``song97''. This will then cite the authors and year for you - change the natbib options in the preamble to get a different citation style.


\section{Theory}

\subsection{Coupling of normal modes}
The Earth is not a perfect sphere, but an oblate spheroid - the radius of the Earth at the poles is 6357km and 6378km at the equator. The asphericity and rotation of the Earth remove the degeneracy of the normal modes. The mode is now a set of $(2l+1)$ singlets. 

% a little maths is included here and some more below. 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:misfit}
\mathrm{misfit} = \frac {\left|z_d - z_s\right| ^2}{z_d^2}
\end{equation}
where $z_d$ is the complex value of the data trace and $z_s$ is the complex
value of the synthetic seismogram trace.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
Mode Studied & Couples With \\
\hline
$_2S_0$ & $_7S_2$ $_6S_2$ $_4S_6$ \\
$_{11}S_1$ & $_{10}S_1$ $_9S_3$ $_7S_5$ \\
$_4S_0$ & $_{10}S_2$ $_{11}S_2$ \\

\end{center}
\end{table}





\section{Conclusions}

It has been shown that when inner core anisotropy is taken into account the difference between the self and full coupling approximation can be large. This is due to the coupling of inner core modes with degree zero, two or four difference in order.

\appendix

\section{Appendix - Theory for normal modes}

The displacement of the Earth, $\mathbf{s}$, can be represented by:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:S}
\mathbf{Hs} + \mathbf{W}\partial_t \mathbf{s} + \mathbf{P}\partial_t^2
\mathbf{s} = \mathbf{S}
\end{equation}

Where $\mathbf{H}$ represents the potential energy operator, $\mathbf{W}$ represents the Coriolis operator, $\mathbf{P}$ is the kinetic energy operator and $\mathbf{S}$ represents the excitation caused by the earthquake source. The solution to this equation will be of the form $s(x,t) = s(x)e^{\imath \omega t}$ where $\omega$ is the radial frequency of the normal mode.
