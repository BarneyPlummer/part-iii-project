To make this report (repostskeleton.tex) into a .dvi file, type:

[name@machine directory]$ latex reportskeleton

You may need to do this a couple of times if the table of contents, figure labels or bibliography have changed - LaTeX will prompt you to do this by saying:

LaTeX Warning: Label(s) may have changed. Rerun to get cross-references right.

Just run LaTeX a couple of times until this warning goes away.

The to update the bibliography (necessary the first time you compile the document and then each time you refer to a new paper) type

[name@machine directory]$ bibtex reportskeleton


To convert a .dvi into a .pdf or a .ps, use:

[name@machine directory]$ dvipdfm reportskeleton

or

[name@machine directory]$ dvips reportskeleton
